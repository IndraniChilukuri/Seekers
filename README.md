We need to follow certain steps to deal with the dataset
# Loan Default Prediction Dataset
    Step 1 :
            *Pre-processing{null-value rectification-has various methods like -> random values
                                                                              -> mode
                                                                              -> Smote(KNN)
            *We must know which column needs what type of null value rectification .  
    Step 2 :                   
            *Remove the outliers.
            *Outliers have a major impact on mean of data
    Step 3 :
            *Standardization and Normalization
            *Understand why we have to do this step?
    Step 4 :
            *Hypothesis Testing
    Step 5 : 
            *Corelation
            *to draw relation between between two fields
            *How it can be used across different combinations (Catogorical and Real)
